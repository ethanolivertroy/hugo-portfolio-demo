SQL injection remains one of the most critical web application vulnerabilities. In this post, I'll walk through a real-world SQL injection discovery, exploitation, and remediation.

## Background

During a recent penetration testing engagement, I discovered a second-order SQL injection vulnerability in a client's web application that could lead to complete database compromise.

## Discovery

The vulnerability was found in the user profile update functionality. While the initial input was properly sanitized, the stored data was later used in an unsafe SQL query:

```python
# Vulnerable code example
username = sanitize_input(request.POST['username'])
save_to_database(username)  # Stored safely

# Later in the code...
user_data = get_from_database(user_id)
query = f"SELECT * FROM logs WHERE username = '{user_data['username']}'"  # VULNERABLE!
execute_query(query)
```

## Exploitation

**Payload used:**
```sql
admin' UNION SELECT table_name,column_name,NULL FROM information_schema.columns--
```

This second-order injection allowed me to:
1. Extract database schema
2. Retrieve sensitive user data
3. Potentially execute system commands (depending on DB permissions)

## Impact Assessment

- **Severity**: Critical (CVSS 9.1)
- **Data at Risk**: All user PII, authentication credentials
- **Potential Impact**: Complete account takeover, data breach

## Remediation

### Immediate Fixes

1. **Use Parameterized Queries**:
```python
# Secure code
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM logs WHERE username = ?", (username,))
```

2. **Input Validation**:
- Whitelist allowed characters
- Implement length limits
- Validate data type expectations

3. **Least Privilege**:
- Database user should have minimal required permissions
- Never use 'root' or 'sa' accounts for web applications

### Long-term Security Improvements

- Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Regular security code reviews
- Automated SAST/DAST in CI/CD pipeline
- Security awareness training for developers

## Testing Your Applications

Use tools like:
- **sqlmap**: Automated SQL injection detection
- **Burp Suite**: Manual testing and validation
- **OWASP ZAP**: Free alternative for vulnerability scanning

```bash
# Example sqlmap command
sqlmap -u "http://target.com/profile?id=1" --batch --dbs
```

## Key Takeaways

1. Second-order SQL injection is often overlooked
2. Never trust data from your own database without validation
3. Defense in depth: combine multiple security controls
4. Regular security testing is essential
