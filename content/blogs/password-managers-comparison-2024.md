After using password managers for 10+ years and testing dozens, here's my honest comparison of the top options in 2024.

## Why Password Managers Matter

**The problem:**
- Average person has 100+ accounts
- Password reuse = single breach compromises everything
- Strong passwords are impossible to remember
- 81% of breaches involve weak/stolen passwords (Verizon DBIR)

**The solution:** Password managers

## Evaluation Criteria

**What I tested:**
- 🔐 Security model (encryption, zero-knowledge)
- 🎯 Usability (browser extensions, mobile apps)
- 💰 Pricing
- 🌐 Cross-platform support
- 🔄 Import/export capabilities
- 👥 Sharing features
- 🆘 Support & recovery
- 🏢 Business/team features

## My Personal Setup

**Current:** Bitwarden Premium ($10/year)

**Why Bitwarden:**
1. Open source (I can audit the code)
2. Self-hosting option (I use cloud, but nice to have)
3. Excellent value ($10/year vs $36-60)
4. TOTP built-in (no separate authenticator app)
5. Active development and responsive team

**My configuration:**
```
Master Password: 6-word diceware passphrase (78 bits entropy)
2FA: YubiKey (primary) + TOTP backup (1Password - yes, I use two!)
Emergency Access: Spouse can request after 7 days
Organizational sharing: For shared accounts with team
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Master Password

**Bad:**
```
Password123!
MyPassword2024
Company@123
```

**Good:**
```
correct-horse-battery-staple-velvet-ocean (diceware)
Tr0ub4dor&3-but-actually-much-longer
Use a passphrase you can remember, not a password
```

**Generate secure master password:**
```bash
# Use Diceware
pip install diceware
diceware -n 6  # 6 words = 77.5 bits entropy

# Or use EFF wordlist
shuf -n 6 eff_large_wordlist.txt | tr '\n' '-'
```

### 2. Enable 2FA on Password Manager

**Options (best to worst):**
1. ✅ **Hardware key** (YubiKey, Titan) - Most secure
2. ✅ **TOTP app** (Authy, separate from password manager)
3. ⚠️ **Email** - Better than nothing
4. ❌ **SMS** - Avoid (SIM swapping attacks)

### 3. Emergency Access

Set up emergency access for trusted person:
- Spouse/partner
- Parent
- Lawyer

**Bitwarden example:**
```
Settings → Emergency Access → Invite Emergency Contact
- Set wait time: 7-30 days
- They can request access
- You're notified and can reject
- After wait time, they get access
```

### 4. Regular Security Audits

**Monthly tasks:**
```
- Review password health report
- Check for breached passwords
- Update weak passwords (< 12 characters)
- Enable 2FA on important accounts
- Remove unused accounts
```

**Bitwarden Vault Health Report shows:**
- Weak passwords
- Reused passwords
- Old passwords
- 2FA not enabled
- Exposed passwords (from breaches)

## Migration Guide

### From Browser-Saved Passwords

**Chrome:**
```
1. chrome://settings/passwords
2. Click ⋮ (three dots)
3. Export passwords
4. Import CSV to Bitwarden/1Password
5. Delete from Chrome
```

**Firefox:**
```
1. about:logins
2. ⋮ → Export Logins
3. Import to password manager
4. Clear Firefox saved passwords
```

### From Another Password Manager

Most support export to CSV:
```
1. Export from old manager (Settings → Export)
2. Import to new manager (Tools → Import Data)
3. Verify all passwords transferred
4. Securely delete export file:
   shred -u passwords_export.csv
```

## Common Questions

**Q: Is it safe to put all passwords in one place?**
A: Yes, IF you use a strong master password + 2FA. More secure than reusing passwords or browser storage.

**Q: What if the company gets hacked?**
A: With zero-knowledge encryption, even if servers are compromised, your encrypted vault is useless without your master password.

**Q: What if I forget my master password?**
A: You're locked out. There's no recovery (by design). Write it down and store securely.

**Q: Should I use the same password manager for personal and work?**
A: No. Use separate accounts/vaults. Use organization features for work sharing.

**Q: Browser password manager vs dedicated?**
A: Dedicated is more secure, better features, cross-browser/platform.

## Final Recommendation

**Best for most people:** Bitwarden
**Best UX:** 1Password
**Maximum security:** KeePass
**Privacy focused:** Proton Pass
**Avoid:** LastPass

**Start today:** Even a basic password manager is infinitely better than:
- ❌ Password reuse
- ❌ Weak passwords
- ❌ Written on sticky notes
- ❌ Saved in browser (unencrypted)
