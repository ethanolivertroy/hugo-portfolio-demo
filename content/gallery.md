## About These Photos

All photos are taken by me during my travels and adventures around the world. As a digital nomad and security professional, I combine my love for technology with my passion for exploring new places and cultures.

**Fun fact:** Every country I visit, I practice security from a different perspective—what can I learn about physical security from ancient fortifications? How do local networks work? What can I learn from different cultures about privacy and security?
